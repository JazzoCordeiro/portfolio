                    <p class="paragraph"><span style="color: var(--letter-b-bright); font-weight: bold;">Welcome! I'm Jazão, but you can call me Jazzo</span> (you can find my full name and
                        other details in the <span style="color: var(--letter-b-bright); font-weight: bold;">"About Me"</span> section).
                        I'm a front-end web developer living in Brazil, 38 years old, and <b>I speak Portuguese, English,
                        and Spanish</b>. This site is available in all three languages.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">This website serves as both my resume and portfolio, and it's also part of my portfolio. Here,
                        you'll find information about like the courses I've studied, certificates, some articles I've
                        written, my projects, and anything else I find interesting. Anything unrelated to work will be
                        placed in the "Miscellaneous" section.
                        You'll also find a summarized resume available for download if you prefer.</p><br>

                    <p class="paragraph">I've been seriously studying front-end web programming since 2023. Before that, I had completed a few personal projects and done some freelance work for
                        friends and family, but I never intended to pursue it as a career. What I mean is that today I
                        am absolutely fascinated by programming, and I plan to dive much deeper into it! How did I not
                        realize this sooner?</p><br>
